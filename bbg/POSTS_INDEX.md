## Post Management Guidelines

### When Adding New Posts:
1. Create the HTML file in `posts/` directory
2. Add entry to this index file
3. Update `blog.html` with the new post
4. Add to recent posts on `index.html` (if current)
5. Update any relevant navigation

### File Naming Convention:
- Use kebab-case: `my-new-post.html`
- Include date in complex titles: `2025-07-my-thoughts.html`
- Keep names descriptive but concise

### Required Meta Information:
- Title
- Date
- Description/Summary
- Tags (optional but recommended)
- Status (Draft, Published, Archived)

## Archive System:
- Move older posts to `posts/archive/` when they're no longer current
- Update links in blog listings
- Maintain this index with archive status
